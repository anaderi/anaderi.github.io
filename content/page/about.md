I'm head of [Yandex School of Data Analysis](https://yandexdataschool.com) research group and [Laboratory of Methods of Big Data Analysis](https://cs.hse.ru/lambda) at [Higher School of Economics](https://hse.ru). Those groups are focused on solving data-intensive tasks from various areas of natural sciences using machine learning techniques. For example members of my team are taking part in [LHCb](https://lhcb.web.cern.ch/lhcb/) experiment at [CERN](https://home.cern), [CRAYFIS collaboration](https://crayfis.io) and others.

This blog _could_ embrace various stuff from biologically engineered pet-food recipes designed by deep learning to music composition history, but mostly it is going focus on such things as

- human mind, consciousness, mindfulness, 
- machine intelligence, data science, meta and fundamental science,
- reproducibility, errors and coincidences

mainly because I'm more sensitive to those. And the main motivation for posting here is getting a better grasp of the content of own mind (sometimes I wish there could be such things as 'contents' to the mind as it is for a regular book). In other words I make posts not to make a pleasant reading, but to make own thoughts a bit more tangible for myself ðŸ˜„. If you find some of those posts interesting as well - I'd be very happy - just leave a comment below.

Meanwhile if you'd like to learn a bit more about projects of my team, you're welcome browse it's [github repositories](https://github.com/yandexdataschool).
